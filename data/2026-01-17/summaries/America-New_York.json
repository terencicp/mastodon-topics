        "section_content": "A majority of posts (94% in polls) express rejection of AI, citing distrust in Big Tech's motives. Critics argue that corporations prioritize profit over societal good, exemplified by AI's role in automating harmful tasks like revenge porn and racist content, while neglecting critical issues like climate change or education. The sentiment is that AI is a tool controlled by billionaires who lack accountability."

        "section_content": "Posts emphasize AI's dual-edged impact: while it offers efficiency in coding and data processing, it exacerbates inequality, job displacement, and surveillance. Concerns include AI's role in content moderation (e.g., filtering harmful material), its potential to erode human control over systems, and the 'genii out of the bottle' metaphor for irreversible consequences. Environmental and resource waste are also cited as negative trade-offs."

There's also a critique of the 'AI revolution' narrative, arguing that top-down control undermines genuine innovation. Posts stress the need for critical thinking, balancing skepticism with curiosity about AI's potential."

Suggestions include corporate accountability, AI-driven content filtering, and rejecting the binary 'yes/no' framing of AI. The emphasis is on human agency, ethical governance, and ensuring AI serves societal needs rather than corporate interests."
