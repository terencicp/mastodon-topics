    "summary": "The United States has revised its childhood vaccine schedule, reducing the number of recommended vaccines from 17 to 11. The change, which eliminates routine shots for diseases like the flu, RSV, and hepatitis, has sparked controversy among public health experts and politicians. Critics argue the decision undermines disease prevention efforts, while supporters, including former President Donald Trump, claim it reduces unnecessary medical interventions. The move has raised concerns about potential increases in preventable illnesses and the scientific rationale behind the revised schedule.",

        "section_content": "The updated schedule, announced by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), removes vaccines for diseases such as rotavirus, pneumococcal conjugate, and hepatitis A. It also phases out the annual flu vaccine for children, replacing it with a single dose every other year. The shift aims to reduce the burden of routine immunizations but has drawn sharp criticism from medical professionals."

The decision has also fueled debates about the role of government in public health, with some arguing that the CDC is overstepping its authority. Advocacy groups have called for reinstating the previous schedule to protect children's health."

However, it has faced pushback from medical associations and parents concerned about child health. The debate underscores tensions between public health mandates, individual choice, and scientific consensus in shaping vaccination policies."
